## üìπ Demo Video Script

**Duration**: 3-5 minutes

### Part 1: Introduction (30 seconds)
```
"Hi! I'm presenting MCG.FUN - AI-powered NFT prediction markets.

We built 4 autonomous AI agents using the ASI Alliance stack to solve 
a real problem: predicting NFT floor prices is hard, and users need 
trustworthy data and intelligent analysis.

Our agents provide market analysis, automated resolution, portfolio 
advice, and verified price oracles - all powered by Fetch.ai uAgents 
and SingularityNET MeTTa."
```

### Part 2: Agent Demonstration (2 minutes)
```
"Let me show you how it works.

[Click 'Ask AI' button]

First, the Market Analyst agent. I'll ask it to analyze this market.

[Type: 'analyze this market']

Watch as it:
1. Fetches the current floor price from OpenSea
2. Analyzes on-chain trading sentiment  
3. Uses MeTTa knowledge graphs to reason
4. Provides a recommendation with confidence

[Show response]

Notice it explains its reasoning - this is MeTTa in action. 
Every recommendation is explainable and traceable.

[Show knowledge/nft_markets.metta file]

Here's the actual MeTTa code. These structured reasoning rules 
power the agent's intelligence.

Now let me check my portfolio.

[Type: 'show my portfolio']

The Portfolio Advisor analyzes all my positions, calculates risk,
and gives personalized advice.

[Show response]

Finally, let me get a verified floor price.

[Type: 'get price']

The Oracle agent aggregates from multiple sources for trustworthy data."
```

### Part 3: Agentverse Deployment (1 minute)
```
"All 4 agents are deployed on Agentverse for FREE.

[Open Agentverse dashboard]

Here they are, running 24/7 with zero backend costs.

[Click on Market Analyst]

Each agent is discoverable, well-documented, and ready to use.

The Resolver agent runs automatically every 10 minutes, 
monitoring markets for resolution deadlines and settling them 
with verified price data.

[Show agent logs]

This is a fully production-ready system that solves real problems 
for NFT traders."
```

### Part 4: Technical Highlights (1 minute)
